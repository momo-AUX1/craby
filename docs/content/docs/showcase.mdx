These benchmarks measure native method throughput for performance comparison only. Real-world results may vary.

Note that each module uses different underlying implementations (e.g., C++, Rust libraries), making perfect performance comparisons difficult.

## craby-sha256

SHA-256 hash function implementation based on the [sha2](https://crates.io/crates/sha2) crate. ([GitHub](https://github.com/leegeunhyeok/craby-sha256))

**Benchmark** (25,000 SHA-256 hash generations):

| Library                   | Time            |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| crypto-js                 | 1367.68ms (x50) |
| react-native-quick-crypto | 922.73ms (x34)  |
| craby-sha256              | **26.96ms**     |

## craby-kv

Embedded-level lightweight key-value storage library based on [sled](https://crates.io/crates/sled) crate. ([GitHub](https://github.com/leegeunhyeok/craby-kv))

**Benchmark** (1,000 iterations of set and get):

| Library                                   | Time           |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| @react-native-async-storage/async-storage | 405.84ms (x58) |
| react-native-quick-crypto                 | 6.71ms (≈)     |
| craby-kv                                  | **6.91ms**     |
